This research investigates the physics of volleyball serves by modeling their projectile trajectories while incorporating air drag and spin effects. Different types of serves—float serve, topspin serve, and jump serve—are examined to understand how variations in spin, velocity, and launch angle influence their flight paths. Theoretical modeling, supported by simulation and informed by experimental literature, helps to quantify apex, range, and flight time. This study aims to enhance understanding of serve effectiveness, optimize training, and support data-driven coaching strategies.
